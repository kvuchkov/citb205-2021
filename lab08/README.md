# Synpsis
In this exercise, we will use the copy constructors of our classes to investigate how many times we are making copies and then eliminate unnessesary copying. We want to focus on eliminating copying of the `Product` class, because it will potentially grow to contain an image of the product, description, links and specifications.

First, implement an explicit copy constructor for each class. Add a `cerr << "..."` message so that you can see whenever the copy constructor is called. Then, start using references and pointers to eliminate copying.

# Clean
1. You first need to have clean repository, i.e. no changes. You have to commit everything you have worked on:
```
git add .
git commit -m "describe your changes"
```

2. Make sure you are on the master: `git checkout master`

# Prepare
1. Get the code. To get updates from github, you just need to run `git pull`. You should now see lab2 folder. 
2. Go to the folder (in the terminal, `cd lab5`)
3. Prepare the build:
  * For Linux/Mac, run: `cmake .`
  * For Windows, run: `cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"`

# Exercise

Don't forget to work in small iterations towards completing the exercise. I will illustrate the steps with a few examples, and then you should try on your own until you get to the final result.
